## 🔒 Security

### Authentication

// Check in admin layout
if (!session?.user) redirect('/auth/signin');
if (!user.isSuperAdmin) redirect('/dashboard');
```

### Authorization Levels
1. **Super Admin** - Full system access
2. **Organization Owner** - Single org admin
3. **Organization Admin** - Limited org access
4. **Organization Staff** - Basic access

### Data Isolation

- RLS still enforced in database
- Admin bypasses RLS for viewing only
