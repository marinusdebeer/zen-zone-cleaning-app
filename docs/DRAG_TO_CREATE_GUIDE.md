```

```
While holding, drag DOWN to the END time
↓
Watch the green selection highlight follow your mouse
```

#### Step 3: Release
```
Release the mouse button

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

## 📍 Where It Works

### ✅ Day View
- **Detail-focused** scheduling
- Full day breakdown
- Single column (day 0)

### ⚠️ Month View

- Use Week/Day for creating

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### Quick Scheduling
1. **Switch to Week view** for the best experience
2. **Scan for gaps** in the schedule
3. **Click-drag-release** in empty slots
4. **Pre-filled times** save you typing
5. **Repeat** for batch scheduling

### Precise Timing
- **Each row = 1 hour** of time
- **Start at top** of desired hour
- **Drag down** for duration
- **Example**: 9 AM → 11 AM = 2-hour job

### Team Coordination
- **See both teams** in Week view
- **Drag in Team A column** to assign there
- **Drag in Team B column** for Team B
- **Filter** to focus on one team

### Avoid Conflicts

```

### Data Flow
```
Drag → Modal → Form → Create
         ↓        ↓       ↓
    Pre-fill  Validate  Save
```
